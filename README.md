# LEPOR: A Robust Evaluation Metric for Machine Translation with Augmented Factors
This repo contains code for a machine translation evaluation metric named LEPOR.

**Note: The code for LEPOR is not available in python yet. The plan is to implement all the variations on LEPOR and publish it as a package. There is also possibility of intigrating it to NLTK or other NLP libraries.**

If you have any suggestions or want to contribute. Create an issue and generate a PR.
