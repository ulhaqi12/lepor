# LEPOR: A Robust Evaluation Metric for Machine Translation with Augmented Factors
Python Package for a machine translation evaluation metric named LEPOR.

## Installation
Requirement: Python 3

**Install pip package**
```bash
pip install lepor
```
## How to Run
#### Calculate the LEPOR for sentences
If you want to check only one sentence:
```python
>>> from lepor import sentence_lepor
>>> reference = 'a bird is on a stone.'
>>> output = 'a stone on a bird.'

>>> sentence_lepor(reference, output)
0.736
```
If you want to check multiple hypothesis (several sentences):
```python
>>> from lepor import corpus_lepor
>>> corpus_lepor(references, outputs)
```
## In Case of Unexpected Outputs
